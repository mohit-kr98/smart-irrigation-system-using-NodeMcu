# smart-irrigation-system-using-arduino

The Project Comprises Of Two units : 
1. Main Unit 
2. Sub  Unit
# Components Required
1. Main Unit
 -> NodeMcu
 -> DH11 (Temperature and Moisture Sensor)
 -> Rain Sensor
 -> LED
2. Sub Unit 
 -> NodeMcu
 -> Soil Moisture Sensor
 -> DC Motor Pump(5V)+ Relay
 
 Note:-  
 1. Refer The Circuit Diagrams And Workflow For Assistance
 2. We are using thingsspeak server to transfer data between main unit and sub unit
 3. For getting the output on app download "Blynk" from play store and use the "send_Senor()" and "print_temp()" function present in "Main_unit.cpp"
